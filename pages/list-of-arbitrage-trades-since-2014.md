List of Arbitrage Trades Since 2014
--------------------

The following are examples of arbitrage trades that Pythagoras has executed in our 8-year history. The rapid growth and complexities of cryptocurrencies have created excellent opportunities for arbitrage trading. Although specific trades may get “arbbed out”, new arbitrage opportunities continue to emerge.  

- Cross-exchange arbitrage 
    - Simultaneously bought bitcoin on Kraken and sold on Huobi 
- Cross-country arbitrage
    - Simultaneously bought bitcoin in the USA and sold in Japan 
- Basis trading
    - Simultaneously bought bitcoin in the spot market and sold in the futures market, where there is a premium price in futures that expire in either one week, one month, or one quarter.
- Cash and carry trade
    - Same as basis trading.
- Funding-rate trading
    - When the markets were bullish, retail investors bought crypto on margin via a perpetual contract and paid an interest or funding rate.  We took the other side, provided liquidity, and thus
     received the funding rate.
- Funding rate arbitrage
    - Simultaneously bought a perpetual with a low funding rate and sold a perpetual contract with a higher funding rate 
- Liquidity arbitrage
    - Simultaneously bought crypto on an exchange with high liquidity and sold on an exchange with less liquidity. Assumes a lead-lag relationship. This is essentially a cross-exchange arbitrage.
- Time zone arbitrage
    - Simultaneously bought in one time zone and sold in another time zone. Assumes a lead-lag relationship. This is essentially a cross-exchange arbitrage.
- Weekend arbitrage
    - Put capital in place before weekends to wait for bigger arbitrage opportunities while fiat banks are closed on weekends. 
- Chinese New Year arbitrage
    - Bought BTC in China and sold BTC in USD markets during the Chinese New Year holidays when Chinese traders are off work.
- Arbitrage between CEX and DEX
    - Simultaneously bought on a centralized exchange and sold on a decentralized exchange, or vice versa. 
- Market making in Defi
    - Providing liquidity, posting bids and offers, making markets, and creating volume in order to earn reward tokens. Example: DYDX.
- POS staking
    - Staking or depositing crypto on Proof-of-stake blockchains to provide crypto with the right to validate transactions on a POS network. 
- Providing liquidity to Decentralized Exchange (DEX)
    - Depositing crypto on a decentralized exchange to facilitate automated market making (AMM) and pairs swapping.
- Yield farming
    - Yield mining, liquidity mining, providing liquidity on DEX, lending platforms, and other defi protocols to earn fees and rewards.
- Volatility arbitrage (event-specific)
    - Bought options with unpriced or underpriced event risk. 
    - Bought cheap puts on Luna on May 7, hedged them over the following days, and then closed them for maximum value.
- Volatility arbitrage (general, centralized exchanges)
    - Bought cheap volatility which is sold into the market as a result of systematic, price-insensitive flow — such as auctions — which can clear at almost any price.
- Volatility arbitrage (general, decentralized exchanges)
    - Systematic screening for cheap synthetic optionality in the decentralized finance ecosystem.
- Shorting UST at $0.99 and bought back UST at $0.30.  
    - Risk return was asymmetrical, similar to our arbitrage trade.  Almost risk-free. 
- Hard-Fork harvesting.  
    - Bought BTC spot and selling BTC futures to harvest Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin ABC, Bitcoin Gold, and Bitcoin Diamond for free as a dividend. This is because the BTC spot split into two tokens and
     BTC futures settled only into one of the tokens, so that we kept the forked asset for free. 
- ETH hard fork to ETH 1 (POW) and ETH 2 (POS)
    - Bought ETH spot and sold ETH futures at flat or contango, as ETH futures went to a discount to reflect the value of the ETH 1 free dividend.  
- Airdrops
    - Earned ZKSync airdrop by making transactions on ZKSync
- Regulatory arbitrage
    - When China banned Bitcoin exchanges in 2017, the price of Bitcoin in China RMB dropped 25%.  We bought Bitcoin in China and sold Bitcoin in USD. 
- ETH merge trading in the forward curve
    - Bought ETH spot, sold ETH future at flat or contango, in anticipation of ETH futures going to discount which was caused by the ETH staking yield. 
- Relatively High-Frequency Trading
    - Bought smaller tokens or their derivatives on less liquid exchanges and sold the same tokens or their derivatives on more liquid exchanges on a high-frequency basis.
- Market making in NFTs and gaming assets
    - Market making with GMT, a fast-growing, highly liquid gaming token of StepN on DEX when it has large trading volume and volatility
- Statistical arbitrage
    - Bought BTC in USD and sell BTC in Korea at a 50% premium in KRW, and closed position at a 30% premium.  

The above list is just a fraction of all the arbitrage trades which have been executed in real time with funds’ assets over the eight-year history of Pythagoras arbitrage trading.
